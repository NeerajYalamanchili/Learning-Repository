# Overview

CS50P is designed as a 10‑week course (plus a final project) for learners with or without prior programming experience. The course uses Python as the primary language and introduces core programming concepts through video lectures, short supplemental videos (“Shorts”), and practical problem sets. Each week follows a consistent flow:

- **Watch Lecture** (with optional Shorts for additional context)
- **Practice via Problem Set**
- **Iterate and Debug** using hands-on exercises

This structure makes it ideal for integrating into a weekly tutoring plan.
