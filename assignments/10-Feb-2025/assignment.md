# Assignment for week of February 10, 2025

1. Create a new Python environment using conda. 
    - Bonus - Find out what conda and mamba are.
    - Bonus - Learn about why we use Python environments: [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/). This article uses `venv` while we're using `conda` and `mamba`. They're basically just different flavors of the same thing.
2. Set up VSCode to use the newly created Python environment from 1.
   - You should verify that you're correctly using your new environment by checking the bottom-right corner of VSCode.
3. Create a new git branch. One common way to name your branches is name it based on something you're working on, e.g., assign_1.
   - Bonus - Learn more about Git. Here are some resources:
     - ["Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course" by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)
     - ["Learn Git In 15 Minutes" by Colt Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)
4.  Write a `Hello World` script in this directory.
5.  Commit and Push your `Hello World` script to your new branch. 
    - Try to write clear commit messages that explain what you're introducing to the codebase.   
6.  Submit a Pull Request and tag me as a reviewer.

This process will give you an illustration of how we are going to do work: 

1. I will put assignments into the appropriate README for that week. 
2. You will create a new branch to complete that assignment and submit a Pull Request (this is basically submitting your assignment) and tag me as a reviewer (asking me to grade your assignment).
3. I will provide feedback on your assignment. If any modifications are required, I will leave those comments as a part of the review. 
   - If there are any changes I've requested, fix the code and push to the current branch. Your fixes will reflect in the PR. 
4. If everything looks good, I will give the go ahead to merge, and you can merge your PR into the main branch.
