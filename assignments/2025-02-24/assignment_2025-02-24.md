# Assignment for the Week of February 24, 2025

So far, we’ve covered the basics of:
- **Functions** and **Variables**
- **Conditionals**
- **Loops**
- **Unit Tests**

However, our coverage has been pretty shallow. This week’s assignment is to **dig deeper** into these topics using any available resources—especially Harvard’s CS50 Python materials at [https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)—so that we can confidently move on to our project. There’s plenty of content out there; feel free to explore online tutorials, videos, and official documentation as well.

If you have extra time, **take a look at**:
- **Exceptions**
- **Libraries**

These topics will also come in handy soon, but if you don’t get around to them this week, **that’s okay**. We can review them in our next session. During our 1:1 time, we’ll go over any sticking points you encounter, clarify questions, and apply these concepts directly to our project.

## What to Do

1. **Revisit or Explore** any of the above topics that need more clarity:
   - Functions, Variables, Conditionals, Loops, and Unit Tests are priority.
   - Exceptions and Libraries are optional if you have time.

2. **Take Notes** on anything you find confusing or want to discuss further. Keep track of:
   - Important syntax and usage details.
   - Common pitfalls or errors you encounter while practicing.

3. **Come Prepared** with questions for our next 1:1 session:
   - Anything is fair game, from deeper conceptual questions to debugging issues.

That’s it! The goal here is to make sure you have a **solid grounding** in the fundamentals before we start building our project. As always, feel free to reach out if you get stuck.
